    <h1>Wired vs Wireless</h1>
    <p>When data is transmitted on a network, it can do so wired or wirelessly. </p>
    <p>Obviously, wired transmission refers to when data is transferred through a cable. USually it's an electrical signal (e.g. in a USB or HDMI cable), or an optical cable using light (usually for audio).</p>
    <p> Wireless uses radio waves / microwaves / infrared waves to transmit / recieve data </p>
  
    <h2> Types of Cabels </h2>
    <p> Wired cable - copper cables come in three types - a coaxial cable, used for audio, which is a single wire that is surrounded by insulation, an unshielded/shielded twisted pair, which are pairs of wires that are insulated / not insulated within. Insulated is better as it prevents EMF interference which causes static. </p>
    
    <p> Copper cables are cheap, but cannot go very far. They have medium/moderate transfer speeds. </p>

    <p> Fibre optic cables - they use thin strands of glass, that reflect light signals within them. Each individual cable can only send data in one direction (unlike insulated copper wires within a bigger cable), so two cables are needed for duplex. Expensive, but very fast and no signal interference </p>

    <h2> Wireless </h2>
    <p>WiFi uses radio waves. DAta is transmitted across a range of frequencies, depending on traffic and preventing clashses / interference. Signals weaken over distance, so is limited by range, especially metal and concrete, it cannot pass thru. Slower than wired connections. </p>
    
    <p> Satellite - a satphone can communicate directly to any other phone in the world, regardless of infrastructure and existance of internet cables. Extremely expensive, and slower. </p>
    <p> Infrared - emits IR light, very short range, must be directly in line of sight, does not work if blocked by any object. Used for TV remotes. </p>
    <p> RFID - uses radio waves to trasmit data to read/write info from tags. Tag doesn't need power, and is cheap. Passive RFID reads, Acive RFID writes data. USed for things like self checkouts, library books, access cards</p>
    <p> Bluetooth - a very low power radio wave, connects directly to the device. Small range. very power efficient. For things like speakers, keyboards, mice, headphones </p>
